This is a partial project code for practice. The data get from the internet.

Since the incomplete in both documents and data(ex: no annotated CRF, no unit in data, and so on), the answer to any question is just guesswork and the hardcode may be applied sometimes. Furthermore, there were data errors during Deidentification. For example, subject NIDA-CSP-1025.157.471603 has been marked as completed the trial. However,  all methamphetamine data was missing. 

It took lots of time to track and compare to understand the data and may miss-understand. Because this demo project is not for submission. Therefore, there are only several domains that were created, and only the tables and graphs that applied in the original paper are created.

The results are not a full match with the study results. This may be caused by the issue mentioned above.

The files are organized as follows:
SAS
├─cmacros
├─Clinical
│  ├─data
│  ├─documents
│  ├─pmacro
│  └─result
└─pub

The common custom macros are stored in the cmacros folder.
The project-specific custom macros are stored in the pmacro folder. Part of macros is modified from other macros that get from the internet
The custom call routines and functions are stored in the pub folder.
